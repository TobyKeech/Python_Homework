### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.

Note that we are only looking for errors here.

**Not** any issues with, i.e.: 
Thinking that methods should be renamed or should be class level, or using string interpolation etc. 

These aren't errors but rather standards that vary from developer to developer. 

Only comment on errors that would stop the tests running.

```python

class CardGame:


  def check_for_ace(self, card):
    if card.value = 1:
      return True
    else
      return False

    # a == must be used to decern equals too not a single = 
    # after else a colon is needed
    # card.value is not defined should be card
   

  dif highest_card(self, card1 card2):
  if card1.value > card2.value:
    return card
  else:
    return card2

#  def is spelt as dif on line 12
# a comma must seperate card1 and card2 in the arguments given
# card must be defined as card1 as stated previously 
# indentation error with the if statement 
  


def cards_total(self, cards):
  total
  for card in cards:
    total += card.value
    return "You have a total of" + total
  
#  total is a undefined variable and should be set to an empty list
# cards is not a list so nothing to loop through should be total
# length of the total list should be used to get your total
```
